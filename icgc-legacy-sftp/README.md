# ICGC legacy SFTP helm chart

https://github.com/overture-stack/pensato

Pensato is an Overture demo SFTP and SCP server that provides access authorization using Ego API Keys.

This chart is published in the ICGC-ARGO charts repo since it is designed to be used with a custom nginx config used in the ICGC Argo RDPC, and thus is not ready to be a stand-alone Overture product chart.
